I am currently an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/aae/). I received my BEng degree from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, China, in 2012, and my PhD degree in Control Science and Engineering from the same university in 2018. Prior to my current position, I held roles as a Postdoctoral Fellow and Research Assistant Professor in the AAE department. Our research works have been recognized with several research grants, including the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Young Scientists Fund, the Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Fund, the State Key Laboratory of Satellite Navigation System and Equipment Technology Open Fund, and so on. I also lead collaborative research projects with industry partners. Additionally, I am a member of the PolyU Intelligent Positioning and Navigation Laboratory.
