- title: "Vector Tracking Loop-Based GNSS NLOS Detection and Correction: Algorithm Design and Performance Analysis"
  image: publist-tim 2020 nlos.jpg
  description: In this work, we analyzed the NLOS effects on both STLs and VTLs mathematically, based on which an NLOS detection and correction algorithm using the VTL was proposed. We used the metric of equivalent noise bandwidth of VTL to find potential NLOS reception and then confirmed it using the time delay of multicorrelator peaks and code discriminator output. The NLOS-induced measurement error was furtherly corrected before being fed forward into the Kalman filter.

  image: publist-vtsdr.png
  description: We developed open-source MATLAB code for GPS VT SDR to enable researchers and scientists to investigate its pros and cons in various applications and under various environments. To achieve this goal, we developed an “equivalent conventional tracking (CT)” SDR as a baseline to compare with VT. The GPS positioning estimator of this equivalent CT is based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF), which has exactly the same state, system, and carrier measurement models and noise tuning method as VT. This baseline provides users with a tool to compare the performance of VT and CT on common ground.
