  description: This paper proposes a random forest (RF)-based multipath parameter estimator that uses random forest regression for parameter estimation, thereby mitigating multipath effect. The proposed RF-based estimator shows better performance than MEDLL for signals with front-end bandwidths of lower than 6 MHz. It also works under weak signal conditions.
