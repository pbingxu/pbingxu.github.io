- title: "Benefits of long coherent integration for CZT-based GPS signal acquisition"
  image: publist-electronics lett-2018.png
  description: In this work, we improve the acquisition precision and sensitivity of the CZT-based acquisition by extending coherent integration time. To reduce computation load, we introduce a down-sampling operation to the extended data without degrading acquisition performance. Results show that the CZT-based acquisition with a coherent integration time of 10 ms obtains a frequency error of 5.9 Hz for the carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) of 25 dB-Hz and can acquire signals with a CNR down to 22 dB-Hz.
