  description: In this work, we analyzed the NLOS effects on both STLs and VTLs mathematically, based on which an NLOS detection and correction algorithm using the VTL was proposed. We used the metric of equivalent noise bandwidth of VTL to find potential NLOS reception and then confirmed it using the time delay of multicorrelator peaks and code discriminator output. The NLOS-induced measurement error was furtherly corrected before being fed forward into the Kalman filter.
